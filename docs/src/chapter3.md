# Start the MiniConda container

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

*When we start the MiniConda contaier we wilf first retrieve the Jupyter API-key. When we login the the key we will see the content of the ~/Test directory. A jupyter directtory called notebooks will be created. In this directory we will use  to `git clone https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering.git` to make a copy of Ed Donner's repository, so rhat we kan easilly upload his Jupyter notebooks.*
